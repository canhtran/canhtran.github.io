Time flies by in the blink of an eye, from 2009 to 2019, ten years have passed. Personally, this decade is very remarkable. It likes an adventure for me; during those years, I joined university, graduated, got my first job, moved to new country, had a master degree and travel to different countries.

## A Decade to Remember

So let's rewind to 2009, year that I stepped through the gate of Ton Duc Thang university. To be honest, the first day wasn't great to me because this is not my choice. I failed my dream university and I also didn't choose to take computer science from beginning.

But somehow, destiny has it own path. Finally I graduated with the CS major.

I must admit that it's a great time for me in those unidays. During that 4 years in the university, I met a lot of friends, some of them are still my brotherhood. I also faced the things that I hadn't did before; from fail the subjects in school to get my first intern job as PHP developers.

Not to mention, I had scholarship from Soongsil university in 2013 and started up my first project: didauxa.net, a property website for students. 
Thing doesn't go your way so after I graduated from both Ton Duc Thang and Soongsil, I join Go1 Vietnam in 2014. While working in GO1, I have another change to meet the incredible "senpais". They was teaching me everything from A to Z to become a web developer (drupal, linux, terminal, deployment... all the latest technologies that I hadn't heard before). I'm very appreciated it. Thank you very much guys, [A Quan](https://github.com/quanvm), [A Sang](https://github.com/sanglt), [A Si](https://github.com/mrsinguyen), [A Chau](https://github.com/pvmchau)

It was a great year to me until I had new opportunity to migrate to Singapore and become the expat in 2015.

I still remember the moments that I won LTA Hackathon, met Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and the happiness of my mom - dad on my graduation day in NUS in 2016.
