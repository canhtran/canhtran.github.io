Hey, These days I'm quite boring so I find something that I can play around. One of my colleage told me about LSTM and RNN with its power of generating the text. Immediately, wow it's awesome, I will try it.

Then I'm starting to google and found this article [here](http://machinelearningmastery.com/text-generation-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/) by Jason Brownlee

I have to said that I don't know anything about the RNN (Recurrent neural network) or LTSM, so I just write the code exactly in the article. But instead of using "Alice in Wonderland", I use the 3 stories from "The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes" for trainning set.


Here is my first attempt result:
It tooks 14 hours on my big data machine (CPU only). Oh Gosh, but it's so excited right ?

Well it can be readable but not what I want to achieve. I need to change something to make it like a "real" story. But first of all I must understand about LSTM and RNN.

I spend around one week on the internet to read and experience with LSTM and RNN. In this mean time, I also increase the epoch to 100 and add one more layer to the code and let's running (It tooks a quite time to run for sure).

The second time running took almost 5 days on the same machine.
