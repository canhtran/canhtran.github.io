Back in my day, I’ve been used IDE for a long time. I found that it (IDE) is so convenient, it offers many features such as syntax highlighting, customisable interface and extensive navigation tools.

Then the time has come, I was inspired by [Wesley](https://github.com/etheleon) when I see him writing his code in VIM. It’s fast, powerful, incredibly extensible and allows you to customise it in the way you most productive, especially when I use the combo VIM + tmux

I’m starting with the first installation of NeoVIM and other basic plugins.

- [scrooloose/nerdtree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) : display the directory tree
- [Shougo/deoplete.nvim](https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim) : autocompletion for NeoVIM
- [vim-airline/vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) : VIM status bar
- [vim-airline/vim-airline-themes](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline-themes) : themes for vim-airline
- [tpope/vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) : Git wrapper

Together with tmux, I’m happy with coding in VIM right now. I’ll keep this post updated whenever I find something interesting that boost up my productivity.
