    <p>
        I am curently working as a full stack data guy at <a href="javascript.void(0);">Grab</a> in Singapore.
        I build the data pipline, data science platform as well as working with data scientist to analyse data, implement algorithms and build data api
    </p>
    <p>
        Before joining Grab, I was a full-time data engineer at <a href="javascript.void(0);">Honestbee</a>. I'm also the founder of couple StartUps,
		but all of them are not very successful.
